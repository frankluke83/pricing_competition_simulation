    "This notebook is similiar to the second part of the `monte_carlo` notebook, but it runs everything for only one price. The time between adjustments of prices gets split into `B` parts and for each purchase the time slot `o` fit is tracked. At the end, it outputs a probability for each time slot, which corresponds to how likely a purchase is in this time slot after a price adjustment. The probabilities are saved in the `cond_prob_out` file."
